        There, I will need a website to display all the services Iâ€™m offering under my company, the prices and deals we offer. 
        As a tours and travel. I also need to display the beauty of the various tourism destinations in Uganda like the Game parks, major sites 
        like source of the Nile for river rafting, the Equator, the great snow capped mountains and the cultures and way of life of different people.
